				<p> Kyle Corpuz is a sweet 9-year old boy who loves to play with his airplane toy and dreams of being a great pilot when he grows up. He loves to play at school with his friends and go fishing with his dad. Our good friend Kyle has his own unique burden, though Kyle is diabetic.
					At a very young age, he learned that he would need to change his diet and regulate his insulin.</p>
					<br>
				<p> Here at McDONUTS, we heard Kyle's story and wanted to help him raise money for his team in the annual Walk to Stop Diabetes.
					Thats why we've designed the new KC donut. This sugar-free baked donut is made of gluten-free flour,granular such as splenda as a sugar alternative, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, egg, butter and milk. And it is topped with unsweetened cinnamon.
					Order a KC donut, and 25% of the proceeds will go to her team.</p>
					<br>
				<p>	"We've been coming to McDONUTS for long as I can remember, and it's really cool to have my own donut on the menu, said Kyle. "I'm so excited to surprise all the other families	 at the walk with the donation in October."	</p>
